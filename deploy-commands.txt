# Run these commands in your terminal:

# 1. Initialize Netlify (choose "Create & configure a new project")
netlify init

# After init completes, deploy with:
netlify deploy --prod

# OR if you want to skip init and deploy directly:
netlify deploy --prod --dir . --site [your-site-name]

# Alternative: Use the Netlify web interface
# 1. Zip your project folder
# 2. Go to https://app.netlify.com
# 3. Drag and drop the zip file
